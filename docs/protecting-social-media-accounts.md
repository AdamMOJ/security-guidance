# Protecting Social Media Accounts

## Summary

Hostile attacks on Social Media accounts pose a serious threat to the Ministry of Justice \(MOJ\) and its reputation. When attacks happen, they quickly become [headline news](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-tweet-civil-service-arrogant-offensive-a9530706.html), and can [happen to any account, anywhere in the world](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/technology/jack-dorsey-twitter-account-hacked.html).

Two types of attacks are common:

-   Attempts to render the account useless by 'bombarding' it with messages.
-   Attempts to 'take over' the account.

## What to do if your account is bombarded

### Remember that these attacks are short lived

Due to the amount of organisation and effort required to coordinate such an attack, they do not last long, and like an intense inferno, will soon burn themselves out.

### Do not respond to the attack

These attacks are designed to attack the person controlling the account as well as the agency itself. By only responding to messages not involved in the attack - especially those trying to share positive messages, the attackers will run out of interest far sooner than if you engage them. If they are posting harmful or threatening messages, report the accounts.

In a single sentence - "don't feed the trolls".

### Feel free to walk away

Dealing with these attacks can be emotionally draining; even just reading the messages can have a far greater impact on you than you realise. Take breaks in the event of an attack, even if it's hard to - consider going for a walk to force yourself away.

## Steps we can all take to protect ourselves

### Ensure our passwords are secure

Passwords are the main protection on our accounts, hence ensuring they are secure is vital. The NCSC has produced [guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0) on making secure passwords - the summary of which is that picking three random words to make a password \(for example `RainingWalrusTeacup`\) is a good policy for securing Social Media accounts.

### Check your email details are up to date

Most of the time, the first indication you'll have that something is wrong is when an email is sent to you. This could be to let you know that someone is attempting to log into your account, or that someone is trying to reset your password, or more concerningly, that a new device has logged into your account. Hence it is important that you ensure that your email details are up to date, and that your email is secure.

### Enable Two Factor Authentication

Two Factor Authentication \(2FA\) involves requiring a random code to be entered before being logged in. These codes are either sent to the user via SMS or email, or generated every 30 seconds by an app or device the user has which relies on a seed key provided by the service. That seed can then be shared amongst a team, allowing for multiple owners or contributors.

If at all possible, SMS generation should be avoided, as it is theoretically possible for phone numbers to be taken over through various attacks, as well as meaning that only one person can receive the code, which isn't ideal if a team is working on a single account.

If youâ€™re using email, then it can be sent to a group account, which also allows for multiple owners or contributors - but it's important to ensure that the email is also protected by 2FA.

If you have a spare 10 minutes, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGRii5f_uSc) for an excellent explanation of how 2FA works and why it's important to have it enabled.
