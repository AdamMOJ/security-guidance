# Lost Laptop or other IT security incident

**This guidance applies to all staff and contractors who work for the Ministry of Justice \(MoJ\).**

## What to do if your device is lost, stolen, or compromised

**Note:** You can help reduce problems by making sure that devices used for MoJ tasks are always shut down before leaving Government premises. Locking a laptop, or 'putting it to sleep' is not completely secure. A lost or stolen laptop can be accessed more easily if it is only locked or sleeping. A shut down makes sure that all security measures are in place, such as full disk encryption.

**Note:** For HMCTS and HMPPS, please follow the procedures on your local intranet.

If you think your device is lost, stolen, 'hacked', or in some way compromised, you must:

1.  Contact your Technology Service Desk. The analyst will ask the relevant questions and note responses on the ticket.
