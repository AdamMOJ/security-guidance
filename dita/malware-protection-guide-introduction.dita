    <title>Introduction</title>
    <body>
      <p>This guide introduces the information which explains your responsibilities in helping the MoJ to prevent, detect and recover from malware. The MoJ has a three layer defence approach aligning with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) guidance to mitigate the risks posed by malware. If one layer of defence is compromised then malware should be blocked or detected by the next layer.</p>

    <title>Assessing the malware risk</title>
    <body>
      <p>Malware can affect different systems in very different ways depending on how they store, process and execute files and potentially attacker-supplied content. Each system needs to be assessed to understand the potential threat from malware to it, and to design appropriate controls for that situation. The MoJ Assurance Framework provides information on how this may be achieved. Contact the <xref href="#contact-details" format="html">Cyber Assistance Team</xref> for help regarding the Assurance Framework.</p>
