# Setting up a DITA development and build environment

5. The installer will check that you have a suitable Java environment (needed to run Eclipse and DITA tooling). It'll suggest directories to install these components. You can change them if you wish (take notes!), but accepting the defaults is a good idea.
6. Read and understand the User Agreement
