# Using LastPass Enterprise

## The product

LastPass is an online password management tool that we make available to you to help you store and share passwords. Using it means you no longer need to remember dozens of passwords, just a single master password. It keeps all your website logins protected, helps with creating new passwords, password sharing where required, and ensuring passwords are suitably strong.

The LastPass software will be installed on your browsers as a browser extension. As you go to work-related sites, save the credentials to your LastPass vault. LastPass will then autofill those passwords the next time you go to log in.

## How to use Last Pass

### Getting Started

You will be sent an email inviting you to create your LastPass account. You need to create a master password - this is the only password you'll need to remember, but it is important that it's long and strong. It also has to be unique.

You next need to install the LastPass browser extension. ( How to do this? Self Service if you aren't on dev build?) 

(something about only using work email address)

### Sharing Passwords
Some services have a corporate login that requires us to share the password for it amongst a group of us. A good example is running a shared Twitter account. Use LastPass to securely share these passwords.

To share a password create a 'shared folder' in the LastPass Vault, and set appropriate permissions on the sharing.


## Best Practices
* Use the password generator to make sure every password is unique and strong
* Create a long, strong Master Password. Use a minimum of 12 characters, but the lengthier the better! Make sure that it is unique only to you, but don't use personal information - it shouldn't be guessable. Make it pronounceable and memorable (e.g., a passphrase) - like: `AwesomeSecurityTeamRulesOK!`
* Never share your Master Password with anyone, including LastPass, our Service Desk, or even our Security Team.
* Never use your Master Password as the password for another account.
* Enable Multifactor Authentication for added security.
* As your LastPass Enterprise account is tied to your work email address, it will stop working when you leave the Ministry of Justice. Therefore, we strongly recommend you only use LastPass Enterprise to store work passwords - as you would lose access to any personal passwords stored in it. If you wish to access personal passwords, you can link your enterprise and personal accounts, which give you access to both from the same browser.
