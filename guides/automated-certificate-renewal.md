# Automated certificate renewal

New MOJ domains **must** use automated certificate techniques and services, such as [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) (most preferred) or [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

Over time, existing MOJ domains must also be updated to use automated certificate provisioning and management techniques.
