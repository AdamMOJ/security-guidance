# Cyber Security Consulting Team: asking for help

## Overview

This document tells you about the Cyber Security Consulting Team, explains how to ask for help, outlines how your requests are handled, and describes what happens next.

To ask for help from a cyber security consultant, send an email to:<br/>
[cyberconsultancy@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:cyberconsultancy@digital.justice.gov.uk)

## About the team

The Cyber Security Consulting Team is part of Ministry of Justice Security & Privacy. The consultants are led by the MoJ Chief Information Security Officer.

The team provides help and guidance around cyber security matters, such as:

- Understanding the risks facing your systems and services.
- Developing services using best practices.
- Checking that third party suppliers have sufficient and appropriate cyber security measures in place.
- Applying IT Security policy to specific scenarios.

## Asking for help

If you need help dealing with a cyber security task or problem, send an email to:<br/>
[cyberconsultancy@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:cyberconsultancy@digital.justice.gov.uk)

Some requests are better handled by other teams. For example, to get help about physical or personnel security (or for urgent matters, such as incidents) you should contact [security@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:security@digital.justice.gov.uk). 

Similarly, for help with data protection, contact [data.compliance@justice.gov.uk](mailto:data.compliance@justice.gov.uk).

The consultant team keep an eye open for email requests. Normally, you will get an acknowledgement or more detailed reply within two working days.

To help us help you, please answer these questions in your email request, as best you can:

1.  Who is the work for?
2.  Why is it important?
3.  What happens if the work is not done (or not done on time)?
4.  What is the requirement (old-style accreditation on an existing contract, guidance or advice, review of proposed approach,...)?
5.  What skills or experience do you believe is required to do the work (known skills/experience, or predicted skills/experience)?
6.  When is the next milestone for the project, where cyber consulting input/involvement is requested?

## How we handle requests for help

Each working day, all new requests are reviewed.

If the request is not appropriate for the team, a reply is sent promptly, explaining why it would be better to talk with a different team. We will usually recommend a more appropriate team in such cases, and provide contact details for them.

If the request is appropriate for the consultants, some initial estimates are immediately carried out, such as:

- Does the request affect many people or services across the MoJ? The wider the range, the greater the impact of the request.
- Does the request require a small or large number of people, or time, to address? Some requests can be answered promptly by an email. Other requests might require a team of 2 or 3 people to be assigned for a 2 month project.
- Does the request need certain skills or experience? This helps determine which consultant might be best placed to help.

The answers to these questions help the team to decide whether a consultant can help immediately or not.

If no consultant is available, the request is put on a 'next day refresh', meaning that it is considered again on the next working day. If a request stays in the 'next day refresh' state for too long - typically a week - it is automatically escalated to higher management for a review and decision.

## What happens next

If your request is not appropriate for the consulting team, you'll be told immediately after the initial assessment concludes.

If your request is appropriate for the consulting team, you'll be contacted directly by the assigned consultant, who will engage directly with you to start providing the help you need.

## If things go wrong...

If you disagree with a decision that your request is not appropriate for the consulting team, or there is some other problem, please contact the team again through the [cyberconsultancy@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:cyberconsultancy@digital.justice.gov.uk) email address.
