# Least Privilege

## The Principle

The principle of least privilege (PoLP; also known as the principle of least authority) is effectively conferring only the minimum number of required privileges required in order to perform the required tasks.

This helps reduce the "attack surface" of the computer by eliminating unnecessary privileges.

Day to day examples include: not ordinarily using an 'administrator' login on an end-user device (such as a laptop) or logging into a server as 'root'.
