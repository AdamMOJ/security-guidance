# Password Managers

## Overview

[MOJ guidance](https://intranet.justice.gov.uk/guidance/security/it-computer-security/ict-security-policy-framework/password-guidance/) makes clear that you should have different passwords for different services. These passwords must be complex.

But how do you remember all these different passwords?

The simplest way is to use a [Password Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager). Using a password manager is effectively essential if you are going to have lots of different, and complex, passwords for all your accounts.

This article provides guidance on using password managers within the MOJ.

## Best practices

The NCSC is [very clear](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/what-does-ncsc-think-password-managers):

> "Should I use a password manager? Yes. Password managers are a good thing."

This is helpful for us in the MOJ, as much of our IT Policy and guidance derives directly from NCSC best practices.

## What makes a good password manager?

A password manager should never store passwords in an unencrypted form. This means that keeping a list of passwords in a simple text file using Notepad would be A Bad Thing.

Good password managers will encrypt the list of passwords in a file using really strong encryption. The result should be that it doesn't matter where the encrypted file is stored. Storing the encrypted password list 'in the cloud' means your password manager can access the data from any device (useful if you are logging in from a laptop, or a mobile device). Conversely, storing the encrypted password list on your local device means the password manager can still work even when you are offline (although that begs the question of why you'd need account details if the service you want to use can't be reached anyway ...)

A good password manager will typically have:

- Really strong encryption for the list of passwords.
- Network access for encrypted lists stored 'in the cloud'.
- A dedicated app but also a 'pure' web browser method for working with your password list.
- A tool to generate passwords of varying complexity.
- The ability to fill in login pages automatically.

## What password manager should I use?

As you'll notice from the [NCSC article](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/what-does-ncsc-think-password-managers), they are very careful not to identify or recommend a password manager. This ... caution ... is the reason why we don't say much about password managers within the MOJ guidance.

However, there are several password managers which are used within the MOJ. Of these, [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) and [1Password](https://1password.com/) are probably the most popular.

The advice is to have a look at these two password managers, see which one you like best, and try it out. When you decide on a password manager, request approval from your line manager to install and use it ("I'm planning to install and use XYZ to manage my passwords, is that OK?").
