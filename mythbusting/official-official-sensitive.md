# OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE

## Purpose

Clarifying OFFICIAL and OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE.

h/t https://www.gov.uk/guidance/official-sensitive-data-and-it

## OFFICIAL

`OFFICIAL` is a UK HM Government information asset classification under the [Government Security Classifications Policy (GSCP)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications).

## OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE

`OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` is **not** a classification. `SENSITIVE` is a handling caveat for a small subset of information marked OFFICIAL that require *special* handling by staff above and beyond the decribed `OFFICIAL` baseline.

You shouldnâ€™t treat all sensitive information equally. Any information marked `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` will need risk appropriate security measures. These security measures will depend on the risks surrounding the information. Security measures already in-place may suffice.

### DESCRIPTORS

Descriptors can be applied to help identify certain categories of `SENSITIVE` information. Where
descriptors are used they must be supported by local policies and business
processes.

Descriptors should be used in conjunction with a security classification and applied in the format: `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE [DESCRIPTOR]`

The Cabinet Office maintains the following list of core descriptors to ensure a consistent
approach is adopted across all departments:

*  `COMMERCIAL`: Commercial- or market-sensitive information, including that
  subject to statutory or regulatory obligations, that may be damaging to HMG or to
  a commercial partner if improperly accessed.
* `LOCSEN`: Sensitive information that locally engaged staff overseas cannot
  access.
* `PERSONAL`: Particularly sensitive information relating to an identifiable
  individual, where inappropriate access could have damaging consequences. For
  example, where relating to investigations, vulnerable individuals, or the personal /
  medical records of people in sensitive posts (e.g. military, SIA).

Descriptors are **not** codewords.
