# Audiences for Security Guidance

This document describes how we structure and target security guidance material.

In creating security guidance, we consider what material is needed. We think about how important the material is for a given audience within the MOJ? We prioritise aspects such as consistency rather than detail.

The reality is that a document might be more relevant or important to some MoJ colleagues than to others. To help us work out the audience for some guidance, we consider: to what extent does the type of thinking/activity addressed by the guidance represent a significant part of the person's role or daily activity?

For example, an executive would be expected to have both a detailed business awareness, and to be using that knowledge in most tasks, most days. By contrast, an administrator will be aware of their role (and that of their team) as part of the broader business, but are unlikely to need to apply that knowledge often - perhaps a couple of times a month, at most?

This approach helps us to identify four generalised groups:

- Executives and Managers
- Staff
- Administrators
- Developers

We also identify a 'catch-all' group:

- Other

There will always be exceptions to the emphasis for each of the audience groups. The purpose of the grouping is to encourage and enable material creation that is styled, presented, and targeted at the general member of that audience. It is perfectly possible, and indeed common, for someone to think of themselves as fitting to a greater or lesser extent into more than one group. It all depends on the task they are doing at the time.

## Executive

These are the people who make business, economic, administrative, legal, governmental, and other high-level decisions about the objectives and work of the other MoJ colleagues. Executives might tend to have less technical knowledge about a subject in comparison to specialists. But they will have - or need - a good generic knowledge. They will certainly have and need an understanding of the interaction between and relationships across the many cyber security components and considerations.

Guidance written for this group will tend to have the following emphasis:

- High: Business awareness
- Medium: Policy detail
- Low: Process, Technology, Operations

### Managers

These are a recognisable variation of the Executive audience, with greater emphasis on the policy and process aspects (organisational lifeblood).

Guidance written for this group will tend to have the following emphasis:

- High: Policy, Process
- Medium: Business awareness
- Low: Technology, Operations

## Staff

These readers tend to have the minimum necessary technical knowledge. They want to use a technology or service to accomplish their tasks. Generally, the detail of cyber security considerations is too much and irrelevant for their day-to-day work. In some cases, they might be curious about a specific technical matter and want to learn about it - but this will be out of interest rather than for a specific, practical reason.

Guidance written for this group will tend to have the following emphasis:

- High: Process
- Medium: Policy, Operations
- Low: Business awareness, Technology

## Administrators

These are the people who know their part of the business or organization inside and out. They have been part of it for years They designed it, they tested it, they know everything about it. Their interest in cyber security will be heavily guided by considerations such as what the guidance enables (traditional CIA, for example) for their business or service. They will also be acutely aware of what the cyber security guidance constrains or prevents.

Guidance written for this group will tend to have the following emphasis:

- High: Process, Operations
- Medium: Policy, Technology
- Low: Business awareness

## Developers

These are the people who build, operate, maintain, and repair the items that the others expect, specify, manage, and use. They have highly technical and often extremely focused knowledge, usually of a more practical nature.

Guidance written for this group will tend to have the following emphasis:

- High: Technology
- Medium: Process, Operations
- Low: Business awareness, Policy
